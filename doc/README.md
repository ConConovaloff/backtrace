 * GitHub: [axypro/backtrace](https://github.com/axypro/backtrace)
 * Composer: [axypro/backtrace](https://packagist.org/packages/axy/backtrace)

It contains some tools to simplify the work with the call stack.

The library is intended primarily for debug.
For example, it used in [axypro/errors](https://github.com/axypro/errors) for cut uninformative part of the stack
(when displaying an exception).

## The library classes

 * [Trace](Trace.md): the call stack.
 * [ExceptionTrace](ExceptionTrace.md): the point of an exception.
